# cppgraphs

Just some graph related code I wrote as part of a C++ refresher course I took on Coursera that I want to keep around for reference.

graph.cpp contains an implementation of  Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. 

mst.cpp constains an implementation of Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
